## Project 1: CV Generator Using Python
 
### Introduction
This project is a personal endeavour where I developed a CV generator using Python. The purpose of this project was to create a professional and customisable CV that I could easily update and format as needed. It serves not only as a functional tool for generating my own CV but also as a demonstration of my programming skills and understanding of data formatting.

### Project Overview
The CV generator utilises the FPDF library to create a structured PDF document that includes essential sections such as:
- Professional Summary
- Key Skills
- Professional Experience
- Education and Certifications
- Additional Information

#### Key Features
- **Customisable CV**: Easily modify the CV content by updating the code to reflect personal information and experiences.
- **Professional Formatting**: The generated CV maintains a clean and professional appearance.
- **Watermark**: Includes an attribution line that states "This was coded and generated by Hasnain Amir," enhancing ownership of the work.
- **Best Practices**: The code follows Python best practices for readability and maintainability, showcasing my programming proficiency.

### My Experience
Working on this project allowed me to:
- Deepen my understanding of the Python programming language, particularly in working with libraries.
- Enhance my skills in data structuring and formatting for professional documents.
- Learn how to effectively use Git and GitHub for version control and project management.
- Experience the process of turning an idea into a functional tool, reinforcing my problem-solving skills.
- Before coding the project, I followed a tutorial that helped me grasp the basics of using the FPDF library, which laid the foundation for my implementation.
